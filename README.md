# About Me
My name is Sara, I am a rising senior in NYU Shanghai and I major in Interactive media and business. My interests include biking, hiking and playing with my cat. I am passionate about literature and history and an avid climate change advocator and animal conservationist. My favorite color is purple.I have never done html and coding before so the concept of it is somewhat intimidating. I am excited to learn more about it though!
